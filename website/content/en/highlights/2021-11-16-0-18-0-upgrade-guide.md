Vector's 0.18.0 release includes one **breaking change**:

1. [`batch.max_size` no longer valid for sinks](#batch-max-size)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### `batch.max_size` no longer valid for sinks {#batch-max-size}

We've finally removed the `batch.max_size` parameter from sinks that support batching.  If you're
currently setting this, you will need to switch to either `batch.max_bytes` or `batch.max_events`.

If you're trying to limit the size of the batch, in terms of bytes, you should use
`batch.max_bytes`.  Otherwise, if you're trying to limit the size of the batch in terms of events,
you should use `batch.max_events`.
