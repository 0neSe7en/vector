Vector's 0.18.0 release includes one **breaking change**:

1. [`batch.max_size` no longer valid for sinks](#batch-max-size)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### `batch.max_size` no longer valid for sinks {#batch-max-size}

We've finally removed the `batch.max_size` parameter from sinks that support batching.  In the past,
this field allowed settings the maximum batch size in a general way, being interpreted by the sink
to mean either bytes or events.  As we add more and more sinks, some which support the notion of
batches being limited by both bytes and events, we've removed `max_size` as a way to ensure every
configuration is clear as to what is being limited rather than forcing users to dig into the
documentation to understand how the sink will interpret `max_size`.

If you're currently setting this, you will need to switch to either `batch.max_bytes` or
`batch.max_events`.  If you're trying to limit the size of the batch, in terms of bytes, you should
use `batch.max_bytes`.  Otherwise, if you're trying to limit the size of the batch in terms of
events, you should use `batch.max_events`.
